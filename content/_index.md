Iâ€™m a data scientist specializing in advanced analytics and AI-driven decision-making. I love programming and collaborating to solve complex data and business challenges. With experience managing data science teams across the US and India, I bridge technical execution and strategic goals. I also excel at translating complex models into clear, actionable insights through well-structured presentations.

Beyond my work, I write about **[Emacs, data science, and Bitcoin](/blog/)**, offer **[consulting services](/consulting/)** for companies looking to make smarter data-driven decisions, and keep an archive of my **[academic work](/academic-work/)**. You can also check out my **[resume](/resume/)** for a full overview of my experience.
