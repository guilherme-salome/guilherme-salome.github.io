<Post title="Disagreement in Market Index Options" date="2024" tags={["Research", "Finance", "Options"]}>

<p>Article published in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jjfinec/nbad017">Journal of Financial Econometrics</a> in 2024.</p>

<p>The article, <em>Disagreement in Market Index Options</em>, explores how investor disagreement about the future performance of the S&P 500 manifests in the options market, with a particular focus on the roles of <strong>moneyness</strong> and <strong>tenor</strong>.</p>

<p>Using high-frequency data analysis, I found that disagreement is minimal for options that are <strong>near the money</strong> and have <strong>short expirations</strong>, where outcomes are more predictable, but it spikes significantly for options that are <strong>far from the money</strong> or have <strong>longer expirations</strong>, which involve greater uncertainty and speculation.</p>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>

<p>This variation in disagreement is important because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It can signal potential <strong>market volatility</strong>—high disagreement often precedes price swings</li>
  <li>It enhances <strong>risk management</strong> by pinpointing areas of investor uncertainty</li>
  <li>It challenges the notion of fully efficient markets by demonstrating that investor opinions diverge in systematic, measurable ways</li>
</ul>
