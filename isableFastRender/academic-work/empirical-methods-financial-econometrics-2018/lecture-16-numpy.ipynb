{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["NumPy is a package for scientific computing in Python.\nIt implements an object to represent N-dimensional arrays (vectors, matrices and higher dimensional matrices).\nIt also has linear algebra functions and random number generators.\n\nWhy do we need Numpy?\nPython is a dynamically typed language, it infers the type of a variable at runtime.\nThis means that when Python store variables in memory, it not only stores the variable's value, but also its type.\nThen, when we perform a computation, like adding two variables ($x+y$), Python looks up the type of $x$ and the type of $y$, and applies the definition of $+$ to those types if it makes sense to do so. If those types are integers, for example, then Python performs an integer addition.\nHowever, if the type of $x$ is inteter, but $y$ is a list, then the operation is not defined and Python will raise an exception (error).\nThis type of checking is called a runtime type check.\n\nThe runtime type check makes programming in Python a pleasure, since you do not have to worry about types all the time.\nHowever, it does lead to inefficiencies when we start performing operations on large datasets.\nNumpy solves those inefficiencies.\n\nNumpy introduces a new type of list, called a numpy `array`.\nIn an array, the type of all elements is the same.\nThis has two benefits.\nFirst, the type is only stored once, so performing operations with numpy is much faster than with Python lists.\nSecond, since all elements have the same type, their position in the memory is easy to compute.\nThis means that accessing random elements in a numpy array is quick.\n\nNumpy also provides a set of operations for numpy array, all implemented in C.\nArrays are not required to be 1 dimensional, so the class can also deal with matrices and higher dimensional arrays.\nNumpy is the base of other higher-level packages, like `pandas` and `scipy`.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["\n# Install\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Numpy can be installed with `pip`.\nAfter activating your environment in the terminal, run:\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["pip install numpy"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Now `numpy` is available for Python and can be imported with:\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["All of the numpy functionality can now be accessed via the object `numpy`.\n\nYou will often see the following command being used:\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Which makes the `numpy` functionality available via `np`.\nThis is often used because it requires less typing to use numpy.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["\n# Basics\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["To create a matrix with numpy we run:\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["This creates a new matrix with dimensions 2 by 4.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["The elements of the matrix can be accessed by using its indices.\nSince the matrix has 2 dimensions, we need to give it two indices: an index for the row and an index for the column.
