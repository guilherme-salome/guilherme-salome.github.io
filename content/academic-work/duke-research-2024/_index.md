The article, *Disagreement in Market Index Options*, explores how investor disagreement about the future performance of the S\&P 500 manifests in the options market, with a particular focus on the roles of **moneyness** and **tenor**. Using high-frequency data analysis, I found that disagreement is minimal for options that are **near the money** and have **short expirations**, where outcomes are more predictable, but it spikes significantly for options that are **far from the money** or have **longer expirations**, which involve greater uncertainty and speculation. This variation in disagreement is important because it can signal potential **market volatility**—high disagreement often precedes price swings—and it enhances **risk management** by pinpointing areas of investor uncertainty. Moreover, my findings challenge the notion of fully efficient markets by demonstrating that investor opinions diverge in systematic, measurable ways, offering valuable insights for traders, analysts, and policymakers alike.
