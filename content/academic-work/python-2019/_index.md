## **Overview**
This course is a fast-paced introduction to Python for PhD students in Economics and related fields.  
The focus of the course is to learn the core of the Python programming language.  
Students will apply Python to solve common problems in Economics, such as estimation and dynamic programming.  
The course is designed for PhD students who have completed their **1st year of coursework** and are interested in learning a **general-purpose programming language**.
Recommended books and materials will be shared in this page.

### **Prerequisites**
- This course is **intended for Duke PhD students**.
- Graduate **econometrics** is required. **Macroeconomics or microeconomics** at the graduate level is also assumed.
- Students should have **basic programming experience** (at the undergraduate level).
- Students **must have a laptop** and bring it to the lectures.

### **Grades**
- Final grade will be based on **completion of assignments**.
- Assignments are due a few days after the **last lecture** of the course.
- **Attendance is mandatory** for all classes.

### **Assignments**
- Problems will be assigned **at the end of each discussed topic**.
- Assignments are **individual**. Each student must:
  - Write **their own code**.
  - Create **their own plots**.
  - Interpret **their own results**.
  - Prepare a **`.pdf` report using LaTeX**.
- The best way to **learn the course contents** is to complete assignments **yourself**.
- **No late projects are accepted**.
- Solutions with **excessive overlap** with another student's work will receive **a zero grade**.
- Students must uphold the **Duke Community Standard.**
